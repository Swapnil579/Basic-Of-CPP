## FlowCharts
FlowCharts is the graphical representation of an algorithm.It makes use of sysmbols which are connected among them to indicates the flow of information and processing.The process of drawing a flowchart of an algorithm is known as "FlowCharts".
## Pseudo Code
Generaic way of representing your algorithm in textual form.
## Compilation Process
High-Level Language(HLL) ->Compiler->Machine Understanding Format.

As we all know the Computer Understands only Binary Number(0 or 1).
