# Understanding For Loop
What is a For Loop and Why is it Used?

A for loop is a control structure in programming that allows you to execute a specific block of code repeatedly. It’s especially useful when you want to perform the same task multiple times without duplicating your code. Let’s break down the essential components of a for loop:

Initialization: You declare and initialize a variable that serves as a counter. This step only happens once at the beginning.

Condition: You specify a condition that determines when the loop should stop executing.

Increment/Decrement: You define how the counter variable changes after each iteration.


## There are mainly two types of loops:
1. Entry Controlled loops: In this type of loop, the test condition is tested before entering the loop body. For Loop and While Loop is entry-controlled loops.

2. Exit Controlled Loops: In this type of loop the test condition is tested or evaluated at the end of the loop body. Therefore, the loop body will execute at least once, irrespective of whether the test condition is true or false. the do-while loop is exit controlled loop.

1. While Loop

While Loop in C++ is used in situations where we do not know the exact number of iterations of the loop beforehand. The loop execution is terminated on the basis of the test condition. Loops in C++ come into use when we need to repeatedly execute a block of statements. During the study of the ‘for’ loop in C++, we have seen that the number of iterations is known beforehand, i.e. the number of times the loop body is needed to be executed is known to us.

2.Do/While Loop

Loops come into use when we need to repeatedly execute a block of statements. Like while the do-while loop execution is also terminated on the basis of a test condition. The main difference between a do-while loop and a while loop is in the do-while loop the condition is tested at the end of the loop body, i.e do-while loop is exit controlled whereas the other two loops are entry-controlled loops. 

Note: In the do-while loop, the loop body will execute at least once irrespective of the test condition.
